# Web 400 - Taco Chefs Feedback

This website seems to be constantly monitored. In fact, the web traffic logs indicate that this website is checked once every minute.

We have reliable intel that the protected portion of this website holds information about the vault. But it seems that only the admin can see the protected part of this page.

To run: `docker-compose up -d` 

To access: `http://<ip>:8345/`

*Hint 1: It seems that the protected web page is using token authentication... is there any way to steal the admin's token?*

*Hint 2: You'll need to get the admin to execute code in their browser.. (javascript is executed client-side) Also, you will probably need this: https://ngrok.com/*
