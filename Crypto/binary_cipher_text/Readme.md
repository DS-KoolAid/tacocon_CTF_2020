# Crypto 200 - Binary Cipher Text??

It looks like the Chefs have moved to a different form of communication.

We were able to intercept these two strings:

Snippet 1: `0000000000000000000000000000000000010000001110110000111100011000001101110001110000100110001110000000110000011010001101100010110000000010000010100001101100010110001100000011010100001100001111000001011000110001001011000000011001010000010011000110101100011100`

Snippet 2: `0101010001100001011000110110111101110011`

Can you use these to figure out what they were saying?

*Hint 1: very exclusive cipher*
