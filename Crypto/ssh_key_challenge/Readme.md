# Crypto 400 - SSH Keys 

This website seems to require a private ssh key to login and see the secret message. We have reliable intel that the key has not been renewed since 2008.

Additionally, we were able to recover the corresponding public key. Is there any way to find the private key?

To run: `docker-compose up -d` 

To access: `http://<ip>:8999/`

**Use public_key.pub**

*Hint 1: There was a problem with ssh keys generated in 2008.*
