# Crypto 500 - File Recovery

Help! We were discovered during our intrusion of the secret Taco bunker. As soon as they discovered us, they began to encrypt their highly sensitive files.

We were discovered on 5/16/20 sometime between 5:25pm and 5:30pm PST! We really need help recovering an important file.

We were able to recover one file because they had it on a backup server: important_image.jpg

But flag.jpg looks to be gone forever!

We were able to find this python script that looks like it was used as the encryption module. Hope this helps!

**Use rr.zip**

*Hint 1: Focus on how the key is generated for the encryption.*

*Hint 2: If you can reproduce the file id, you know how to reproduce the encryption key. The encryption key was generated very shortly after the file id...*
