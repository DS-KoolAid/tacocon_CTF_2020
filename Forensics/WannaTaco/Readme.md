# Forensics 500 - WannaTaco

As we were recovering the data from the computer found in the bunker it was hit with a new strain of ransomware!

We really need the information in this file. Is there anything you can do to help us?

In addition to the encrypted file, we were able to pull a small dump of storage from the filesystem before everything got encrypted. Hope it helps!

**Use flag.wntco and mem.dump**

*Hint1 : This malware seems to follow the WannaCry encryption methods very closely... check out the file headers should give you a really good hint.*

*Hint2 : It looks like there may be a private RSA key in the storage dump... will probably need to parse that out.*
