## Challenge Text
Welcome! Thank you for joining the Thwarting All Catastrophes Organization or T.A.C.O.

We've received an urgent message from one our agents about an incoming disaster, but it is encoded. Our codebreakers haven't been able to crack it.

Can you help us find out what they're trying to say?

**Moderator Note:**

All flags have the format `Tacocon{s0m3_text_1n_here!!}`

Once the CTF opens on June 1st, there will be a place to submit the flag.

While Challenge Zero is the first challenge, it does not mean it is the easiest. There will be an easier set of challenges available during the CTF for beginners. However, if you are new to CTFs, we still encourage you give this one a shot!
