			<p>Within this bunker, I believe there is a secret cache of tacos. These tacos are enough to solve the world's shortage.</p>
			<p>However, the stash appears to be locked in a vault deep in the bunker. I've found a computer containing  documents, websites, and codes that should lead us to how to unlock the vault.</p>
			<p>I request assistance in discovering the secrets of this bunker. I've uploaded the data from the computer <a href="https://tacocon.party/challenges">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Good luck -- Agent Taquito</p>
