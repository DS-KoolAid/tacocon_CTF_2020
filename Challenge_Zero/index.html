								A
								<span>taco</span>
								is a
								<span>traditional Mexican dish</span>
								consisting of a 
								<span>small hand-sized corn or wheat tortilla</span>
								topped with 
								<span>a filling.</span>
								The 
								<span>tortilla</span>
								is then folded around 
								<span>the filling and eaten</span>
								by hand. A 
								<span>taco</span>
								can be made with a variety of 
								<span>fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, vegetables, and cheese,</span>
								allowing great 
								<span>versatility and variety.</span>
								They are often 
								<span>garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream, and vegetables,</span>
								such as 
								<span>lettuce, onion, tomatoes, and chiles. Tacos</span>
								are a common form of 
								<span>antojitos,</span>
								or 
								<span>Mexican street food,</span>
								which have spread around 
								<span>the world.</span>
							</p>
							<p class="redacted">
								<span>Tacos</span>
								can be 
								<span>contrasted with similar foods such as burrito, which are often much larger and rolled rather than folded, taquitos which are rolled and fried, or chalupas/tostadas,</span>
								in which the 
								<span>tortilla</span>
								is 
								<span>fried before filling.</span>
							</p>

								The 
								<span>origins</span>
								of the 
								<span>taco</span>
								are not precisely known, and 
								<span>etymologies</span>
								for the 
								<span>culinary usage</span>
								of the word are 
								<span>generally theoretical.</span>
								According to the
								<span>Real Academia Española, publisher of Diccionario de la Lengua Española,</span>
								the 
								<span>word taco</span>
								describes a 
								<span>typical Mexican dish</span>
								of a 
								<span>maize tortilla</span>
								folded around 
								<span>food.</span>
								This meaning of the 
								<span>Spanish word "taco"</span>
								is a 
								<span>Mexican innovation,</span>
								but in other 
								<span>dialects "taco"</span>
								is used to 
								<span>mean "wedge; wad, plug; billiard cue; blowpipe; ramrod; short, stocky person; [or] short, thick piece of wood." In this non-culinary usage, the word "taco"</span>
								has 
								<span>cognates in other European languages,</span>
								including the 
								<span>French word "tache" and the English word "tack (nail)."</span></p>
							<p class="redacted">
								According to 
								<span>one etymological theory, the culinary meaning of "taco" derives from its "plug" meaning as employed among Mexican silver miners,</span>
								who used 
								<span>explosive charges in plug form</span>
								consisting of a 
								<span>paper wrapper and gunpowder filling.</span>
							</p>
							<p class="redacted">
								<span>Indigenous origins</span>
								for the 
								<span>culinary word "taco"</span>
								are also proposed. One 
								<span>possibility</span>
								is that the 
								<span>word derives</span>
								from the 
								<span>Nahuatl word "tlahco", meaning "half" or "in the middle,"</span>
								in the sense that 
								<span>food would be placed</span>
								in the middle of a 
								<span>tortilla.</span>
								Furthermore, 
								<span>dishes</span>
								analogous to the 
								<span>taco</span>
								were known to have 
								<span>existed in Pre-Columbian society—for example, the Nahuatl word "tlaxcalli" (a type of corn tortilla).</span>
